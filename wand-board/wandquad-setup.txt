This directory contains files pertaining to the Wandboard Quad.
This document also serves as build instructions for Genode targetting
the Wandboard Quad platform.

================
GENERAL OVERVIEW
================

build.conf
	A file with changes made to boot Wandboard Quad

good-boot.txt
	A file containing Minicom output of a successful
	build/boot of "run/log" as shown how to do in
	this file with the "hw" kernel

uImage
	A precompiled image file created for Wandboard Quad
	using "make run/log KERNEL=sel4"

=============
PREREQUISITES
=============

From "../README.txt"
==================== 
Under the 'PREREQUISITES' section complete the following 
subsections:
	'Genode Setup'
	'Serial Setup'
	'SD Card Setup'

====================
Wandboard Quad Setup
====================

Genode Configuration
====================
Step One
--------
Create the build directory:

	cd <genode>
	./tool/create_builddir wand_quad
	cd build/wand_board

Step Two
--------
We must edit the file etc/build.conf to create a uImage instead of a ELF
image, otherwise the board will throw an error when booting.

The line below can be inserted directly after the "ifdef KERNEL" on line 20. 
A copy of this file with the change is located in this directory.

	vim etc/build.conf
		+ RUN_OPT += --include image/uboot

Build HW Kernel
===============
Once completed we are ready to build for the board.
There are various options to choose from but for an initial test run 
the following:

	cd <genode>/build/wand_board/
	make run/log KERNEL=hw

The following errors and their solutions during this build process
can be found below:

	ERROR: mkimage missing
	SOLUTION sudo apt-get install u-boot-tools

	ERROR: Failed: no xmllint insalled
	SOLUTION: sudo apt-get install libxml2-utils

Loading Image onto SD Card
==========================
The image file will be located in "var/run/log". Copy this image into the
OS accessible partition of the SD card. It should be named "uImage".

Running Wandboard Quad
======================
Use the SD Card slot located next to the USB slot. Connect Wandboard to 
your local machine using a Serial-to-USB cable and a null modem adapter.
To boot up the Wandboard with this image apply power and enter the 
u-boot prompt by distrupting the boot process.

The following commands will boot Genode:

        fatload mmc 0 0x30000000 uImage
        bootm 0x30000000

See the file "good-boot.txt" to know what the output of the above 
image should look like.
