This contains an overview of this directory and the files 
contained within it.

This also hosts the setup instructions for u-boot and
SD cards.

================
GENERAL OVERVIEW
================

SPL
	A file downloaded for use on SD cards. It can be
	obtained with the following command:
	wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/imx6/boot/wandboard/SPL

u-boot.img
	A precompiled u-boot file with the necessary changes for 
	Wandboard Quad

wandboard.h
	This file contains a change necessary for building of
	u-boot

=============
PREREQUISITES
=============

From apt-get (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
===============================
	sudo apt-get install bison
	sudo apt-get install flex
	sudo apt-get install binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf 
	sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
	sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler

==================
SD Card Formatting
==================
First run a check to find the desired device name.

        sudo fdisk --list

Look for the disk that has the correct size of the SD card inserted.
Once found note the /dev/sd* name of the device. We will use sd* 
here to denote the selected user disk.

        umount /media/<user>/<device-name>

The above command will unmount any partition that the SD card may
have had that was auto mounted by Ubuntu. This should auto-complete
however be sure that you select the correct device to unmount
before continuing.

The next step is to enter the Command Line Interface (CLI) utility known 
as "parted". We will give it the device we wish to perform actions 
with as its argument.

        sudo parted /dev/sd*

The commands from here on will be in "parted" and not on the main CLI.

        mklabel msdos
        mkpart primary fat16 1049KB 100%
        quit

Upon the "quit" command you should have returned to the main CLI. The above
commands relabel the SD card as a type MS-DOS and create a FAT16 partition
from 0 to 1049KB of the card. This area is unaccessible to us via standard
GUI systems. We will now format the rest of the card and place two files
within the unaccessible portion at that start of the SD card.

=============
SD Card Setup
=============
There are two ways to approach setting up the SD Card; pre-build and manually. 
First is using the files in this given directory which have been pre-built. The
second is to create your own files manually.

The second set of instructions is both 
	a) documentation of what was done to create the 'u-boot.img' in 
	this directory
	b) give a new user the rough guideline if the need arises to 
	rebuild the image with a newer version of u-boot.

Pre-built Instructions
======================
Follow the instructions in 'SD Card Formatting'. Return here when complete.
Then do the following:

	cd [this-dir]
        sudo mkfs.fat /dev/sd*1
        sudo dd if=SPL of=/dev/sd* seek=1 bs=1k
        sudo dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/sd* seek=69 bs=1k

With that you are completed.

Manual Instructions
===================
This section will give detail on how to manually create the necessary
files for the SD card.

u-boot Creation
---------------
We will clone u-boot from GitHub and build this from source.

        git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git

Once cloned find the wandboard header file and add the define line
above the SATA config block. A copy of this file (with the change) 
can be found in this directory.

        cd <u-boot>/include/configs/
        vim wandboard.h
                + #define CONFIG_CMD_ELF

Once changed we can build the u-boot image.

        cd <u-boot>
        make wandboard_defconfig
        make u-boot.img ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
        
NOTE: That these is a "-" at the end of the CROSS_COMPILE argument.
This is NOT a mistake and must be present.

The following errors and their solutions during this build process
can be found below:

	THROWN BY: make wandboard_defconfig
	ERROR: /bin/sh: 1: bison: not found
	SOLUTION: sudo apt-get install bison

	THROWN BY: make wandboard_defconfig
	ERROR: /bin/flex: 1: flex: not found
	SOLUTION: sudo apt-get install flex

	THROWN BY: make u-boot.img ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
	ERROR: make: arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc: Command not found
	SOLUTION: $ sudo apt-get install binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf 
		        gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf

	THROWN BY: make u-boot.img ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
	ERROR: Your dtc is too old, please upgrade to dtc 1.4 or newer
	SOLUTION: $ sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler

Next follow the 'SD Card Formatting' section above. Return here when done.
After the SD Card has been created do the following:

        sudo mkfs.fat /dev/sd*1
	cd [dir-containing-SPL-file]
        sudo dd if=SPL of=/dev/sd* seek=1 bs=1k
	cd [dir-containing-uboot-image-file]
        sudo dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/sd* seek=69 bs=1k

NOTE: See the PREREQUISITES section of this file for how to obtain the
SPL file.
