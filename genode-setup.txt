This file is a setup guide for Genode on the build system
for either Wandboard Quad or SabreLite.

This must be done before either can be built and the
notation of <genode> from this document will be used
in all install instructions.

==============
PRE-REQUISITES
==============

From apt-get (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
===============================
	sudo apt-get install git
	sudo apt-get install make
	sudo apt-get install python
	sudo apt-get install python-pip
	sudo pip install future
	sudo pip install tempita
	sudo pip install ply
	sudo apt-get install expect
	sudo aapt-getpt install tcl
	sudo aapt-getpt install libxml2-utils
	sudo apt-get install u-boot-tools
	sudo apt-get install minicom

Genode Toolchain
================
	wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/genode/files/genode-toolchain/17.05/genode-toolchain-17.05-x86_64.tar.xz/download
	mv download genode-toolchain-17.05-x86_64.tar.xz
	cd /
	sudo tar Jxvf [path-to]/genode-toolchain-17.05-x86_64.tar.xz

============
Genode Setup
============
Preselected Genode versions used/tested are located in genode-zips/. 
To obtain your own Genode zip file head to:
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/genode/files/genode/

After unzipping the selected Genode version to where you
like, move into its directory. <genode> will denote the location
that you have unzipped the folder.

If you want a fresh copy of Genode straight from source (non-zipped):
	git clone git://github.com/genodelabs/genode.git

===============
Genode Overview
===============
There are a few commands that are helpful to us which we will
cover here:

./tool/ports/list
	This command will list all avalible ports that the current
	Genode version supports. 

./tool/ports/prepare_port [port-name]
	This command will setup Genode to support the given port 
	name. Port names come from the list command (above) and
	will NOT auto-complete in bash.

./tool/create_builddir [build-name]
	This command creates the build/<build-name> directory
	where we can create a version of Genode to run on the
	desired system.
