This file contains necessary steps to build Genode for the SabreLite
board using the HW kernel built into Genode.

=============
PRE-REQUISTES
=============
- Pre-requistes from "../README.txt"
- The "Update Build Script" from "README.txt" 
- The "Create Spec Files" from "README.txt"

=============
BUILD PROCESS
=============

Most steps in this process will follow the following format:
1 - 'cd' to the proper directory
2 - Copy one folder, rename it, this is generally performing
    the copy of a 'wand_quad' folder and renaming it to 'sabre_lite'
3 - Change various files in the new 'sabre_lite' folder created to
    remove mentions of 'wand_quad' in various forms to conform
    to new board change.

NOTE: The commands for a quick search and replace are show here for 
convience if you are using Vim. Be sure to replace all instances of 
WAND_QUAD, Wand_quad and wand_quad with SABRE_LITE, Sabre_lite 
and sabre_lite respectively.

STEP ONE
--------
cd <genode>/repos/base-hw/lib/mk/spec
cp -r wand_quad/ sabre_lite
vim bootstrap-hw.mk
	:%s/wand_quad/sabre_lite/g

STEP TWO
--------
cd <genode>/repos/base-hw/src/bootstrap/spec/
cp -r wand_quad/ sabre_lite
cd sabre_lite
vim board.h
	:%s/WAND_QUAD/SABRE_LITE/g
	:%s/wand_quad/sabre_lite/g
	:%s/Wand_quad/Sabre_lite/g

STEP THREE
----------
cd <genode>/tool/run/boot_dir
vim hw
	+20 if {[have_spec "sabre_lite"]} { return "0x10001000" }

STEP FOUR
---------
cd <genode>/repos/base-hw/lib/mk/spec/imx6
vim core-hw.mk
	~ # INC_DIR += ...
	+ ifeq ($(filter-out $(SPECS),wand_quad),)
	+	INC_DIR += $(REP_DIR)/src/core/spec/wand_quad
	+ endif
	+ ifeq ($(filter-out $(SPECS),sabre_lite),)
	+	INC_DIR += $(REP_DIR)/src/core/spec/sabre_lite
	+ endif

Comment out the INC_DIR line on line 10.
In its place add the ifeq structure above.

STEP FIVE
---------
cd <genode>/repos/base-hw/src/core/spec
cp -r wand_quad/ sabre_lite
cd sabre_lite
vim board.h
	:%s/WAND_QUAD/SABRE_LITE/g
	:%s/wand_quad/sabre_lite/g
	:%s/Wand_quad/Sabre_lite/g

Build HW Kernel
===============
cd <genode>
./tool/create_builddir sabre_lite
cd build/sabre_lite
make run/log

Running Built Image
===================
See "README.txt" and the sections 'Loading Image onto SD Card'
and 'Running SabreLite' for more details.
